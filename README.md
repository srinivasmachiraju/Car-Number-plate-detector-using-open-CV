# Car-Number-plate-detector-using-open-CV

This file is basically designed to indentify the number plate of the vehical especially car's. I used harcasade car number detector for this project. The main objective of this project has been completed i.e., I am able to identify the number plates in 3/5 times. But I planned to take this project further by even extractin the text from the obtained image. I am using OCR for that. The second half isn't completed.
